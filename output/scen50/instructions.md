# Instructions

These are the results for the simulations study with Coarsened DD, exploiting 50 predictive biomarkers.
Results are generated using the file `PPMX.R` in the `/doc/simulations-cov` folder. 
To process them use the `/doc/simulations-cov/gatherppmx.R` file. 
For a more efficient script use the file `ppmx_par.R` to perform parallelized prediction.
